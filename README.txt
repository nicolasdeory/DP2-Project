This is Acme Work-Plans, our first project in D&T.

Acme Work-Plans is a web aplication with different functionalities.
You can write shouts anonimously, including author, text and an optional link. Everyone can read them.
Also if you sign up and become manager, you will be able to create your own tasks, which includes a title, a short description, the workload, the execution period and URL. Then you can assign them to a workplan, which is a group of task, and give it a name, description, the execution period (suggested automatically) and selecting all the task you want into it.

Task and workplan can be either public or private, and depending on what you select, some other users will be able to see them in Acme Work-Plans or not.

Another functionality involves an administrator role. With it, you will be able to control the dashboard, that resumes a lot of metrics of task, workplans and their attributes, and also, you will be able to control a spam feature to avoid some words in Acme Work-Plans.
